            <p>Welcome to Ramble Farms!  We are a hops, fruit and vegetable farm in Arvada, Colorado.  </p>
        <p>What started as an acre in the spring of 2019 has grown to 9 acres and we are now a complete processing facility which includes a Wolf harvesting machine, a three level commercial dryer and a state of the art pelletizing system.</p>
         <p>We offer a variety of hops, depending on the time of year:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Rhizomes in the spring</li>
            <li>Wet hops in August</li>
            <li>Pellets by early November</li>
    </ul>
        </aside>

        <p>Hoppity Hop!</p>
            <p>Hops pellets don’t get any fresher than this! In addition, we provide pelletizing/packaging services to growers seeking to convert their whole cone hops into quality pellets.</p>

<p>We welcome brewers to visit and camp on our farm during the growing season. It’s a wonderful opportunity to escape to the country and experience the magic of a hop yard. </p>

<p>In late spring and early summer, we have weekly "Market Days" that are open to the public for purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Check back in the spring for the latest updates!</p>
